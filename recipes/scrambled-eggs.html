    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Cooking isn't about always doing the right thing, and this summer scramble is a perfect example. Adding juicy, sweet cherry tomatoes to a scramble tastes great, but it's not a common practice since having a pool of liquid under your eggs is considered bad form. I don't care; I have toast. Try to find a goat milk feta cheese for this; it's awesome!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    

    <ul>

      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>9 cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of crumbled feta cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pinch of sea salt</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>


      <ol>

        <li>Beat eggs and red pepper flakes together in a bowl. Stir tomatoes, feta, and basil leaves into egg mixture</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a non-stick skillet over high heat until oil starts to shimmer. Pour egg mixture into hot oil and cook, without stirring, for 5 seconds</li>
        <li>Cook and stir egg mixture until eggs are scrambled and softly set, about 30 seconds. Transfer eggs to a plate and sprinkle with sea salt</li>
  
      </ol>
