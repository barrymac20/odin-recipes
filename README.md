Odin Project - Recipes Project

This is the first project on the "Odin Project" foundations course and will help me put what I've learned so far about HTML into practice. The project consists of creating a very basic webpage that will contain some links to my favourite recipes. By the time this project is complete I hope to have been able to demonstrate the following skills:

  - Creating HTML files with the correct layout
  - Add a list in my HTML code to include three recipes
  - Add links to each recipe in the list using the anchor (<a>) tag and source (src) attribute
